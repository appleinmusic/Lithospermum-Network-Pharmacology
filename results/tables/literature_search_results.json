    "abstract": "Mpox (MPX) has escalated into a public health emergency of international concern, necessitating urgent prophylactic and therapeutic measures. The primary goal of this investigation was to systematically extract Wan Quan's expertise in treating smallpox, as documented in Exclusive Methods for Treating Pox (Dou Zhen Xin Fa in Chinese), with the aim of identifying potential prescriptions, herbs, and components for alternative MPX therapies or drugs. This research utilized data mining to identify high-frequency Chinese Medicines (CMs), high-frequency CM-pairs, and CM compatibility rules. Network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamic simulation were employed to reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of the core CM-pair. 119 prescriptions were extracted from Exclusive Methods for Treating Pox. We identified 25 high-frequency CMs and 23 high-frequency CM pairs among these prescriptions. Combined association rule mining analysis, Gancao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.), Renshen (Panax ginseng C. A. Mey.), Danggui (Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels), Shengma (Cimicifuga foetida L.), and Zicao (Lithospermum erythrorhizon Siebold & Zucc.) were selected as the core CM-pair for further investigation. Network pharmacology analysis yielded 131 active components and 348 candidate targets for the core CM-pair. Quercetin and celabenzine were chosen as ligands for molecular docking. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses revealed that the core CM-pair could interact with targets involved in immune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. Moreover, key mpox virus targets, F8-A22-E4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme and profilin-like protein A42R, were docked well with the selected core components. And molecular dynamic simulation indicated that the component (quercetin) could stably bind to the target (profilin-like protein A42R). Our findings identified potential prescriptions, herbs, and components that can offer potential therapies or drugs for addressing the MPX epidemic.",

Our data showed that XZF aqueous extract effectively reduced skin toxicities induced by Erlotinib in vivo using established mice model. Next, we used a systems pharmacology approach to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of XZF with the goal of understanding its effects at the system, organ, and molecular levels. 44 candidate compounds and 103 potential targets were identified by network pharmacology. Inflammation, cell stress and the EGFR-related signal pathways, which may participate in the skin protection afforded by XZF, were analyzed by gene enrichment. Importantly, our in vivo experimental results largely validated XZF's mechanism of action, as predicted by the system pharmacology analysis. Our study uncovered the effect and mechanism of XZF in attenuating skin toxicities induced by EGFRI, providing a basis for the development of in-hospital preparations and new drugs for the prevention of skin toxicities.",

Exploring the key genes of retinal neovascularization is crucial for developing new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify key genes associated with retinal neovascularization in Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR), intending to develop new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This would further our understanding of the progression of diabetic retinopathy and improve patient prognosis.MethodsThe gene data from 36 diabetic retinopathy patient samples and 45 samples from healthy volunteers or diabetic patients were selected from the GEO DataSets (Gene Expression Omnibus), specifically datasets GSE102485 and GSE160310. Utilizing the SVA algorithm to merge datasets and the limma package in R to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we conducted a bioinformatic analysis of diabetic retinopathy. Functional insights were gained through DAVID database analyses, while STRING database-derived Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks visualized in Cytoscape provided further context. Key genes were identified through LASSO regression and SVM analyses, with ROC curves assessing their diagnostic value. Single gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) enhanced our understanding of the perturbed biological processes and pathways, advancing knowledge of diabetic retinopathy at the genomic level.ResultsA rigorous bioinformatic analysis yielded a comprehensive list of 1139 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which six pivotal genes-KDM5D, AC007040.11, AC015688.3, NLRP2, GYPC, and TMSB4Y-were identified as central to the study. These six genes consistently demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy, with each exhibiting an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) exceeding 0.75. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis elucidated their primary roles in intricate biological processes, including inflammatory and immune responses, T-cell activation, cell apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment revealed their involvement in crucial signaling cascades such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, cell adhesion molecule pathways, PI3K-Akt signaling, and hematopoietic cell lineage, further substantiating their significance in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.",

Therefore, our study will elucidate the mechanism of Polygonatum against AD based on network pharmacology and molecular docking. The active ingredients and corresponding targets of Polygonatum were identified using the traditional Chinese medicine systematic pharmacology database and analysis platform. Disease targets of AD were retrieved from the therapeutic target database, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, GeneCards, and Disgenet databases. Using the STRING database, we constructed protein interaction networks and performed gene ontology functional enrichment analysis as well as Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis on common targets. We then drew drug-component-target-pathway-disease network maps using Cytoscape 3.10.1 software and validated the molecular docking using AutoDock4. A total of 10 active ingredients and 108 common targets were screened from Polygonatum, 29 genes (including AKT1 and STAT3) were identified as core genes. According to gene ontology analysis, the core targets were found to be mainly involved in signal transduction, positive regulation of gene expression, negative regulation of the apoptotic process, and so on. The Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis revealed that the signaling pathways comprised pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The molecular docking results indicated that 10 of active ingredients from Polygonatum exhibited strong binding affinity with the 6 core targets that were screened before. The activity of Polygonatum against AD could be attributed to the regulation of multiple biological effects via multi-pathways (pathways in cancer, pathways of neurodegeneration - multiple diseases, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway). The binding activities were estimated as good level by molecular docking. These discoveries disclosed the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway characteristics of Polygonatum against AD, providing a new strategy for such medical problem.",

This study aims to utilize an integrated bioinformatic analyses and experimental validations to investigate PHKA1 in lung cancer. Bioinformatic tools provided a pan-cancer perspective, emphasizing PHKA1's oncogenic potential such as GEPIA and UALCAN revealed significantly elevated mRNA expression of PHKA1 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) across various stages, highlighting its diagnostic significance. The study also explored the impact of PHKA1 on immune cells in LUAD, finding strong correlations between high PHKA1 expression and increased presence of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages using TIMER 2.0 database. Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots showed that patients with elevated PHKA1 levels had poorer prognoses, reinforcing its potential as an oncogenic gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by KM plotter. Immunohistochemistry by HPA database supported these findings, demonstrating increased PHKA1 protein levels in lung cancer tissues. Protein-protein interaction analysis using STRING and cytoscape identified a network of genes linked to PHKA1 in NSCLC, offering insights into its functional interactions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis suggested that PHKA1 might be involved in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, known for its role in cell growth and survival, further supporting its oncogenic role. Experimental validation through RT-PCR and Western blot confirmed elevated PHKA1 expression in A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. Moreover, deletion of PHKA1 reduces cell growth and promotes apoptosis in A549 cells and confirmed by Western blot. In conclusion, this comprehensive study suggests that targeting PHKA1 in NSCLC could be a promising therapeutic strategy, highlighting its crucial role in the molecular landscape of lung cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of Sufentanil on acute lung injury in septic mice based on network pharmacology and animal experiments, and to provide new ideas for clinical treatment. To this end, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for common targets was first constructed with Swiss Target Prediction Database, GeneCards Database, Draw Venn Diagram Software, STRING 11.5 Database, Cytoscape 3.10.0 Software and Metascape Database, and then key targets were subject to enrichment analysis by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) to obtain the key targets of Sufentanil for the treatment of pulmonary sepsis, and then verified by animal experiments. A sepsis model was constructed by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in this study, and lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were taken from each group of mice. The morphological changes of lung tissues and apoptosis were observed by HE and TUNEL staining, the content of inflammatory factors in the lung tissues was detected by ELISA, and the expression of proteins, such as p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, was detected in the lung tissues by Western blotting. According to the results of network pharmacology, a total of 40 common targets of were screened out for Sufentanil and pulmonary sepsis, and GO enrichment analysis involved 1,483 biological processes (BPs), 84 cellular components (CCs) and 125 molecular functions (MFs); KEGG enrichment analysis identified 137 signaling pathways with p < 0.05 such as JAK-STAT. According to the results of animal experiments, compared with the control group, mice in the model group had severe lung tissue injury and elevated expression of relevant inflammatory factors in lung tissue. Compared with the model group, CLP + Sufentanil group showed reduced pathomorphologic lesions, lower expression of inflammatory factors and apoptosis level, as well as lower expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 proteins in lung tissue. The results of animal experiments were consistent with network pharmacology. In summary, Sufentanil may improve lung injury in septic mice by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which provides a basis for research on the mechanism of Sufentanil on pulmonary sepsis and clinical treatment.",

The knowledge of the collective molecular activities of these plants facilitates mechanistic studies and expanded applications. A number of databases provide information about the effects and targets of various plants and ingredients. More comprehensive information is needed for broader classes of plants and for the landscapes of individual plant's multiple targets, collective activities and regulated biological pathways, processes and diseases. We therefore developed a new database, Collective Molecular Activities of Useful Plants (CMAUP), to provide the collective landscapes of multiple targets (ChEMBL target classes) and activity levels (in 2D target-ingredient heatmap), and regulated gene ontologies (GO categories), biological pathways (KEGG categories) and diseases (ICD blocks) for 5645 plants (2567 medicinal, 170 food, 1567 edible, 3 agricultural and 119 garden plants) collected from or traditionally used in 153 countries and regions. These landscapes were derived from 47 645 plant ingredients active against 646 targets in 234 KEGG pathways associated with 2473 gene ontologies and 656 diseases. CMAUP (http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/CMAUP/) is freely accessible and searchable by keywords, plant usage classes, species families, targets, KEGG pathways, gene ontologies, diseases (ICD code) and geographical locations.",

Developing an oral formulation that encapsulates and delivers multiple active ingredients to target colon tissues by suppressing intestinal inflammation and restoring the intestinal barrier is crucial for effectively treating UC. Here, we developed rhubarb-derived nanovesicles (RNs) and a supramolecular hydrogel platform formed by furfural-functionalized chitosan-mannose polymer and synthesized 3-maleimide HP-β-CD, with kaempferol (Kae) integrated into the hydrophobic cavity. The hydrogel's cross-linking network effectively encapsulates RNs, forming the Kae/CMCHD@RNs system. Rheology, SEM, TGA, degradation behavior, in vitro drug release, and a macrophage-targeted permeability test were performed. The results indicate that the hydrogel utilizes pH/enzyme sensitivity to ensure sustained release in the colon, while also facilitating targeted delivery to macrophages. In vivo imaging further reveals a prolonged local drug retention time in the colon. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate RNs and Kae exhibit synergistic therapeutic effects for UC, including inflammation reduction, oxidative stress alleviation, M1-to-M2 macrophage repolarization, and restoration of the intestinal barrier. Consequently, this study underscores the potential of Kae/CMCHD@RNs as a promising therapeutic approach for managing UC.",

Specifically, a hydrogel was synthesized by blending chitosan, Pluronic F-127, and tripolyphosphate, utilizing both ionic bonding and copolymer micelle cross-linking techniques. This hydrogel demonstrated exceptional biocompatibility, temperature responsiveness, pH-dependent biodegradation, and controlled release properties. The average pore diameter of the optimal hydrogel expanded to 45 μm, accompanied by zeta potentials of +34.72 ± 4.13 mV. The loading efficiency notably surpassed 90 %, while the sustained release of recombinant human bone morphogenetic proteins 9 (rhBMP9) was observed to last over 25 days at pH = 6.0 and over 36 days at pH = 7.4. This chitosan-based hydrogel, which sustained rhBMP9 release, significantly enhanced the proliferation and migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells and promoted osteogenesis and angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our study presents an rhBMP9-loaded chitosan-based composite hydrogel system that offers innovative avenues for the research and clinical application of advanced biomaterials in the treatment of early ONFH.",

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the active components and mechanisms of BSTZC in treating HLP by integrating serum pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, network analysis, and experimental validation. We first established UPLC fingerprints, calibrated 23 common peaks, and identified 13 common peaks, and the similarity was greater than 0.99 for 10 batches.

DGSND's chemical components and targets were found utilizing the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Disease-related genes associated with ED were identified through GeneCards, OMIM, TTD, DrugBank, and DisGeNET databases. These datasets intersected to identify possible DGSND targets for treating ED. We developed an interactive visual network that linked herbs, active components, diseases, and targets using Cytoscape 3.7.1. The protein-protein interactions (PPI) were analyzed using the STRING database. The DAVID database was used to conduct gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment studies to determine the mechanism of action of the discovered genes. The pathways most strongly associated with ED were analyzed through histograms and bubble maps. From the PPI network, the 6 promising targets were selected for molecular docking with the top ranked compounds in terms of degree value. DGSND contains 7 Chinese herbal medicines, 142 main components, and 73 latent targets for treating ED. GO and KEGG analyses suggest that DGSND may have the ability to modulate oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses. Through the PPI network and topology analysis, 6 core genes were pinpointed. Molecular docking revealed that beta-sitosterol exhibited the lowest binding energy with BCL2, indicating a more stable structure. This study demonstrates that DGSND's compounds stimulate NO synthesis and reduce inflammation and cell apoptosis to improve ED by acting on AKTI, ALB, IL6, TNF, TP53, and BCL2. The findings show that DGSND's compounds These findings offer a valuable scientific foundation for further understanding the mechanism of DGSND in treating ED.",

    "abstract": "Drug development remains a critical issue in the field of biomedicine. With the rapid advancement of information technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the advent of the big data era, AI-assisted drug development has become a new trend, particularly in predicting drug-target associations. To address the challenge of drug-target prediction, AI-driven models have emerged as powerful tools, offering innovative solutions by effectively extracting features from complex biological data, accurately modeling molecular interactions, and precisely predicting potential drug-target outcomes. Traditional machine learning (ML), network-based, and advanced deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and transformers play a pivotal role. This review systematically compiles and evaluates AI algorithms for drug- and drug combination-target predictions, highlighting their theoretical frameworks, strengths, and limitations. CNNs effectively identify spatial patterns and molecular features critical for drug-target interactions. GCNs provide deep insights into molecular interactions via relational data, whereas transformers increase prediction accuracy by capturing complex dependencies within biological sequences. Network-based models offer a systematic perspective by integrating diverse data sources, and traditional ML efficiently handles large datasets to improve overall predictive accuracy. Collectively, these AI-driven methods are transforming drug-target predictions and advancing the development of personalized therapy. This review summarizes the application of AI in drug development, particularly in drug-target prediction, and offers recommendations on models and algorithms for researchers engaged in biomedical research. It also provides typical cases to better illustrate how AI can further accelerate development in the fields of biomedicine and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The biological targets of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are the core effectors mediating the interaction between TCM and the human body. Identification of TCM targets is essential to elucidate the chemical basis and mechanisms of TCM for treating diseases. Given the chemical complexity of TCM, both in silico high-throughput compound-target interaction predicting models and biological profile-based methods have been commonly applied for identifying TCM targets based on the structural information of TCM chemical components and biological information, respectively. However, the existing methods lack the integration of TCM chemical and biological information, resulting in difficulty in the systematic discovery of TCM action pathways. To solve this problem, we propose a novel target identification model NP-TCMtarget to explore the TCM target path by combining the overall chemical and biological profiles. First, NP-TCMtarget infers TCM effect targets by calculating associations between herb/disease inducible gene expression profiles and specific gene signatures for 8233 targets. Then, NP-TCMtarget utilizes a constructed binary classification model to predict binding targets of herbal ingredients. Finally, we can distinguish TCM direct and indirect targets by comparing the effect targets and binding targets to establish the action pathways of herbal component-direct target-indirect target by mapping TCM targets in the biological molecular network. We apply NP-TCMtarget to the formula XiaoKeAn to demonstrate the power of revealing the action pathways of herbal formula. We expect that this novel model could provide a systematic framework for exploring the molecular mechanisms of TCM at the target level.

The LTACas13a method has shown excellent performance in screening FEN1 inhibitors and detecting endogenous FEN1 activity in living cells, as well as in clinical biological samples such as human serum and tissue samples. Additionally, using a universal dumbbell probe derived from FEN1, a multiplex LTACas13a strategy is developed for detecting various DNA glycosylases, including formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase, uracil DNA glycosylase, and human alkyl adenine DNA glycosylase. This straightforward approach provides a reliable and effective diagnostic tool for early-stage cancer detection and offers significant opportunities for FEN1 biosensing and related drug discovery.",

Literature on AIH treated with TCM for was retrieved from WANFANG DATA, China national knowledge infrastructure, and CQVIP databases. The herbals listed in all the prescriptions were analyzed for frequency, correlation, association, and clustering, to filter out the core TCM formula for treating AIH. The core herbals included in the core TCM formula were selected to construct an intersection target network of core herbals-active ingredients-disease-related targets. Gene ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were then conducted to reveal the potential mechanism of the core TCM formula in treating AIH. A total of 122 Chinese herbal compound prescriptions involving 196 Chinese herbals were included in this study. These herbals were mostly sweet or bitter in taste, cold in property, and restoring the liver and spleen meridian. Based on the results of frequency, correlation rules, and clustering, the combination of \"Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid-Bupleuri Radix-Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf.\" was considered as the core TCM formula in treat AIH, which contains 113 active ingredients (including quercetin, kaempferol, naringenin, licochalcone A, and formononetin) and 138 AIH-related targets (involving TP53, AKT1, JUN, STAT3). Moreover, the targets regulated by the core TCM formula are mainly enriched in the biological processes, such as cellular response to lipids, response to inorganic substances, response to hormones, and IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The core TCM formula \"Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz.-Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid-Bupleuri Radix-Poria cocos (Schw.)

Eighteen active ingredients in 6 herbs of JSK were found to be correlated with inflammation, spinal injury and other diseases. These 18 active ingredients target 5464 genes according to the PubChem database. Through comparing differentially expressed genes between SCI and normal samples using GSE datasets, 50 hub genes were identified. These hub-genes were enriched in oxidative stress response and inflammation response. The herb-compound-target, herb-compound-signalling and compound-target-signalling networks were generated and quercetin was identified as the hub compound. A concentration of 25 μM quercetin showed no cytotoxicity but significantly protected microglial cells from LPS-induced inhibition of cell viability. LPS stimulation elevated the levels of iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α but decreased IL-10 levels, whereas quercetin significantly attenuated LPS-induced alterations in these factors. Moreover, quercetin targeted gene, IL1R1 was reduced by quercetin as predicted. Overexpression of IL1R1 further increased LPS-induced inflammation, which could be partly reversed by quercetin treatment. In vivo, quercetin improved histopathological alterations, inflammation and promoted M2 macrophage polarisation post-injury, whereas IL1R1 overexpression partially attenuated the beneficial effects of quercetin on the rat SCI model. Collectively, quercetin, the main ingredient compound of JSK, protects against LPS-induced cell viability inhibition and cellular inflammation, which could be partially attenuated by IL1R1 overexpression.",

    "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a systemic allergic disease that has a considerable impact on patients' quality of life. Current treatments include antihistamines and nasal steroids; however, their long-term use often causes undesirable side effects. In this context, traditional Asian medicine (TAM), with its multi-compound, multi-target herbal medicines (medicinal plants), offers a promising alternative. However, the complexity of these multi-compound traits poses challenges in understanding the overall mechanisms and efficacy of herbal medicines. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of these multi-compound herbal medicines specifically used for AR at a systemic level. We utilized a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency method to select AR-specific herbs and constructed an herb-compound-target network using reliable databases and computational methods, such as the Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness for compound filtering, STITCH database for compound-target interaction prediction (with a high confidence score threshold of 0.7), and DisGeNET and CTD databases for disease-gene association analysis. Through this network, we conducted AR-related targets and pathway analyses, as well as clustering analysis based on target-level information of the herbs. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was conducted using a protein-protein interaction network. Our research identified 14 AR-specific herbs and analyzed whether AR-specific herbs are highly related to previously known AR-related genes and pathways. AR-specific herbs were found to target several genes related to inflammation and AR pathogenesis, such as PTGS2, HRH1, and TBXA2R. Pathway analysis revealed that AR-specific herbs were associated with multiple AR-related pathways, including cytokine signaling, immune response, and allergic inflammation. Additionally, clustering analysis based on target similarity identified three distinct subgroups of AR-specific herbs, corroborated by a protein-protein interaction network. Group 1 herbs were associated with the regulation of inflammatory responses to antigenic stimuli, while Group 2 herbs were related to the detection of chemical stimuli involved in the sensory perception of bitter taste. Group 3 herbs were distinctly associated with antigen processing and presentation and NIK/NF-kappa B signaling. This study decodes the principles of TAM herbal configurations for AR using a network pharmacological approach, providing a holistic understanding of drug effects beyond specific pathways.",

However, researchers are encountering challenges due to the fragmented nature of the data and the reliance on programming tools for data analysis. We have developed TCMNPAS, a comprehensive analysis platform that integrates network formularology and network pharmacology. This platform is designed to investigate in-depth the compatibility characteristics of TCM formulas and their potential molecular mechanisms. TCMNPAS incorporates multiple resources and offers a range of functions designed for automated analysis implementation, including prescription mining, molecular docking, network pharmacology analysis, and visualization. These functions enable researchers to analyze and obtain core herbs and core formulas from herbal prescription data through prescription mining. Additionally, TCMNPAS facilitates virtual screening of active compounds in TCM and its formulas through batch molecular docking, allowing for the rapid construction and analysis of networks associated with \"herb-compound-target-pathway\" and disease targets. Built upon the integrated analysis concept of network formulaology and network pharmacology, TCMNPAS enables quick point-and-click completion of network-based association analysis, spanning from core formula mining from clinical data to the exploration of therapeutic targets for disease treatment. TCMNPAS serves as a powerful platform for uncovering the combinatorial rules and mechanism of TCM formulas holistically.

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effect of most traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) on ulcerative colitis is unclear, The objective of this study was to develop a core herbal screening model aimed at facilitating the transition from active ulcerative colitis (UC) to inactive. We obtained the gene expression dataset GSE75214 for UC from the GEO database and analysed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between active and inactive groups. Gene modules associated with the active group were screened using WGCNA, and immune-related genes (IRGs) were obtained from the ImmPort database. The TCMSP database was utilized to acquire the herb-molecule-target network and identify the herb-related targets (HRT). We performed intersection operations on HRTs, DEGs, IRGs, and module genes to identify candidate genes and conducted enrichment analyses. Subsequently, three machine learning algorithms (SVM-REF analysis, Random Forest analysis, and LASSO regression analysis) were employed to refine the hubgene from the candidate genes. Based on the hub genes identified in this study, we conducted compound and herb matching and further screened herbs related to abdominal pain and blood in stool using the Symmap database.Besides, the stability between molecules and targets were assessed using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation methods. An intersection operation was performed on HRT, DEGs, IRGs, and module genes, leading to the identification of 23 candidate genes. Utilizing three algorithms (RandomForest, SVM-REF, and LASSO) for analyzing the candidate genes and identifying the intersection, we identified five core targets (CXCL2, DUOX2, LYZ, MMP9, and AGT) and 243 associated herbs. Hedysarum Multijugum Maxim. (Huangqi), Sophorae Flavescentis Radix (Kushen), Cotyledon Fimbriata Turcz. (Wasong), and Granati Pericarpium (Shiliupi) were found to be capable of relieving abdominal pain and hematochezia during active UC. Molecular docking demonstrated that the compounds of the four aforementioned herbs showed positive docking activity with their core targets. The results of molecular dynamic simulations indicated that well-docked active molecules had a more stable structure when bound to their target complexes. The study has shed light on the potential of TCMs in treating active UC from an immunomodulatory perspective, consequently, 5 core targets and 4 key herbs has been identified. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for subsequent management and treatment of active UC with TCM, as well as offer original ideas for further research and development of innovative drugs for alleviating UC.",

This study aimed to evaluate the potential lipid-lowering effects of QSG in an HLP rat model and investigate possible mechanisms. The HLP rat model was induced by a high-fat diet. Lipid-related indicators in serum were detected. Serum and liver metabolites were investigated using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach. A herb-compound-target-metabolite (H-C-T-M) network was further constructed to reveal the possible molecular mechanism of QSG to alleviate HLP.",
