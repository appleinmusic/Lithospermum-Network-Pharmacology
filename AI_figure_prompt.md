# Gemini Image Generation Prompt for a Scientific Workflow Diagram (Text-Free, Bulletproof)

## Prompt for High-Quality, Text-Free Scientific Workflow Diagram (Gemini Optimized)

This prompt has been further refined to be as explicit as possible about excluding all text, ensuring Gemini produces a clean visual template.

**Instructions:** Copy the entire text block below and paste it directly into the Gemini chat prompt.

### **The Prompt for Gemini:**

**Create a high-resolution, ultra-detailed scientific workflow diagram for a network pharmacology study. The final output must be a pure visual template with absolutely no text. This is for a top-tier scientific journal like Nature or Cell.**

**Core Requirements:**
*   **ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT:** This is the most critical instruction. The diagram must be completely free of any and all text, including letters, numbers, symbols, or any form of writing. The image should contain only shapes, icons, and lines.
*   **Aspect Ratio:** Generate the image in a widescreen **16:9 aspect ratio**.
*   **Background and Flow:** The diagram must have a clean, professional **white background**. The visual flow should be logical and clear, progressing from left to right.
*   **Aesthetic Style:** The style must be **minimalist, modern, and professional**, rendered as a **flat, vector-style graphic**. Use sharp, precise lines and absolutely **no shadows, gradients, or photorealistic textures**.
*   **Color Palette:** Employ a sophisticated and cohesive color scheme. Use a base of blues, teals, and cool grays, and use a single bright accent color, like gold or orange, to highlight key elements.

**The diagram must be divided into the following five distinct visual stages, described using only visual concepts:**

1.  **Stage 1: Data Acquisition:** Begin with a stylized, abstract icon of a database or a server. From this icon, illustrate clean lines or data streams flowing outwards. These streams can contain faint, generic molecular structures to represent the data.

2.  **Stage 2: Compound Screening:** Show the data streams from the first stage flowing into a minimalist icon of a filter or a funnel. From the bottom of the filter, show fewer, more refined streams or distinct molecular shapes emerging. Ensure some shapes are visually depicted as being discarded or blocked by the filter.

3.  **Stage 3: Network Construction:** Depict a complex but orderly web of abstract nodes and edges. This should visually represent a protein-protein interaction network, looking intricate yet well-structured.

4.  **Stage 4: Bioinformatic Analysis:** Use an icon of a magnifying glass positioned over abstract, graphical representations of data. These visuals should include simplified, unlabeled bar charts, a heatmap grid with clear color variations, and a circular plot.

5.  **Stage 5: Mechanistic Elucidation:** Conclude the workflow with an icon of a glowing lightbulb or a brain containing subtle gear outlines. This final visual should be a simplified, synthesized network where a few central nodes are highlighted or glowing, representing the key mechanistic findings.

**Final Check: Before generating, confirm that the image will contain zero text elements.**
