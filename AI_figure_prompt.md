## Prompt for High-Quality Scientific Workflow Diagram

Below is a detailed prompt designed to generate a high-quality, publication-ready scientific workflow diagram using AI image generation tools like Midjourney or DALL-E 3.

---

### **The Prompt:**

**"A high-resolution, ultra-detailed, scientific workflow diagram for a network pharmacology study, in the style of a top-tier scientific journal (e.g., Nature, Cell). The diagram should be clean, modern, and professional, with a white background and a clear, logical flow from left to right. It should be divided into five distinct stages, each with a clear title and a representative icon.**

**The stages are:**

1.  **Stage A: Data Acquisition**
    *   **Icon:** A stylized database or server icon.
    *   **Description:** Show data streams (e.g., molecules, protein structures) flowing from the database.
    *   **Keywords:** CMAUP v2.0, Traditional Chinese Medicine, *Lithospermum erythrorhizon*, Active Compounds, Protein Targets.

2.  **Stage B: Compound Screening**
    *   **Icon:** A filter or funnel icon.
    *   **Description:** Illustrate molecules passing through a filter, with some being rejected.
    *   **Keywords:** ADMET Screening, Drug-like Properties, Lipinski's Rule of Five, Oral Bioavailability.

3.  **Stage C: Network Construction**
    *   **Icon:** A network graph icon with interconnected nodes.
    *   **Description:** Depict a complex web of nodes (proteins) and edges (interactions).
    *   **Keywords:** Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) Network, STRING Database, High-Confidence Interactions.

4.  **Stage D: Bioinformatic Analysis**
    *   **Icon:** A magnifying glass over a bar chart or a heat map.
    *   **Description:** Show abstract representations of data analysis, like enrichment plots and network topology graphs.
    *   **Keywords:** Hub Gene Identification, GO & KEGG Enrichment, Pathway Analysis, Topological Analysis.

5.  **Stage E: Mechanistic Elucidation**
    *   **Icon:** A lightbulb or a brain icon with gears.
    *   **Description:** A final, synthesized view showing key proteins (like PTGS2, CYP450s) at the center of a simplified network, representing the uncovered mechanism.
    *   **Keywords:** Multi-Target Mechanism, Inflammation, Metabolism, Synergistic Effects.

**Overall Style:**
*   **Aesthetics:** Minimalist, flat design with a sophisticated color palette (e.g., blues, teals, and grays with a single accent color like orange or green).
*   **Typography:** Use a clean, sans-serif font like Helvetica or Arial for all labels.
*   **Layout:** Horizontally oriented, with clear arrows indicating the progression from one stage to the next. Ensure ample white space.
*   **Format:** Vector graphic style, sharp lines, no shadows or gradients.
*   **Final Output:** --ar 16:9 --style raw --quality 1 --v 6.0"
